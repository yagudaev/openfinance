# API Overview

OpenFinance exposes a set of API routes that power the web application. These routes handle authentication, file uploads, statement processing, and AI chat.

## Base URL

When running locally, the base URL is:

```
http://localhost:3000/api
```

For self-hosted deployments, replace with your configured `BETTER_AUTH_URL`.

## API Routes

| Route | Method | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/auth/**` | Various | BetterAuth authentication endpoints |
| `/api/upload` | POST | Upload bank statement PDF files |
| `/api/process-statement` | POST | Trigger AI processing of an uploaded statement |
| `/api/chat` | POST | Send a message to the AI financial advisor |

## Authentication

All API routes (except `/api/auth/**`) require an authenticated session. Requests must include the session cookie set by BetterAuth during login.

See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) for details on how sessions work.

## Request Format

API routes accept JSON request bodies unless otherwise noted (file uploads use `multipart/form-data`).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: better-auth.session_token=..." \
  -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What was my income last month?"}]}'
```

## Response Format

All API routes return JSON responses. Errors follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized"
}
```

The chat endpoint returns a streaming response using the Vercel AI SDK's `UIMessageStreamResponse` format.

## Rate Limits

OpenFinance does not enforce rate limits by default since it is self-hosted. If you expose your instance publicly, consider adding rate limiting at the reverse proxy level.
