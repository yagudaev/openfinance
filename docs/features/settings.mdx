# Settings

The Settings page lets you configure OpenFinance to match your financial setup. Navigate to **Settings** from the sidebar.

## Fiscal Year

Configure when your fiscal year ends. This affects date range filters and reporting periods throughout the app.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Fiscal Year End Month** | December (12) | The month your fiscal year ends |
| **Fiscal Year End Day** | 31 | The day of the month your fiscal year ends |

Common configurations:
- **Calendar year**: December 31 (default)
- **Canadian corporate**: March 31, June 30, or September 30
- **US government fiscal year**: September 30

## Timezone

OpenFinance supports separate timezone settings for your bank and your display:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Bank Timezone** | America/Vancouver | Timezone used to interpret dates on bank statements |
| **User Timezone** | America/Vancouver | Timezone used for displaying dates in the UI |

Setting the correct bank timezone ensures that transaction dates are interpreted accurately from your bank statements.

## AI Configuration

### AI Model

Select which AI model to use for the financial advisor chat. The default is `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, but Cerebras (`openrouter/cerebras/auto`) is recommended for fast responses. The model identifier follows the `provider/model-name` format and any model available on OpenRouter can be used.

### AI Context

Provide free-text context about your financial situation. This context is included in every AI chat conversation to help the advisor give more relevant answers.

Examples of useful context:
- Your business type and industry
- How many clients or income sources you have
- Which bank accounts are personal vs. business
- Any specific financial goals or concerns

## Bank Accounts

The Bank Accounts section lists all accounts that have been detected from uploaded bank statements. For each account, you can configure:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Nickname** | A friendly name (e.g., "Business Checking") |
| **Account Number** | The bank account number (detected from statements) |
| **Bank Name** | The name of the bank (detected from statements) |
| **Currency** | CAD or USD |
| **Account Type** | Chequing, Savings, Credit Card, or other |
| **Ownership Type** | Personal or Business |

Bank accounts are created automatically when you upload a statement from a new account. You can edit the details here to add nicknames and correct any misdetected information.
