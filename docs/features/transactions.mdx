# Transactions

- **Balance** -- running balance after the transaction (when available)
- **Category** -- the assigned category
- **Bank / Account** -- which bank account the transaction belongs to

## Searching and Filtering

Use the filter bar at the top of the page to narrow down transactions:

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Search** | Free text search on transaction descriptions |
| **Date range** | Today, 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, custom range, or all time |
| **Account** | Filter by specific bank account |
| **Statement** | Filter by a specific statement period |
