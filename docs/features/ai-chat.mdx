# AI Chat

OpenFinance includes a built-in AI financial advisor. Ask questions about your finances in natural language, and the AI queries your actual transaction data to provide answers.

## Getting Started

Navigate to **Chat** from the sidebar. Type a question and the AI will use your transaction history to respond.

## What Can You Ask?

The AI advisor can answer questions about your financial data:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Spending Analysis">
    - "How much did I spend last month?"
    - "What are my biggest expense categories?"
    - "Show me all transactions over $500"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Income Tracking">
    - "What was my total income this year?"
    - "How does this month's income compare to last month?"
    - "Show me all income transactions from January"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cash Flow">
    - "What's my cash flow for Q4?"
    - "Am I spending more than I earn?"
    - "Show me monthly income vs expenses for the past 6 months"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Account Overview">
    - "What are my current account balances?"
    - "How many bank accounts do I have?"
    - "What's the latest balance on my checking account?"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Available Tools

The AI has access to four tools that let it query your data in real-time:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_transactions` | Search and filter transactions by description, date range, category, or type |
| `get_account_summary` | Get a summary of all bank accounts with their latest balances |
| `get_cashflow` | Calculate income vs. expenses for any date range |
| `get_category_breakdown` | Get a breakdown of spending by category for any period |

The AI automatically selects the right tool based on your question. It can chain multiple tool calls together for complex queries.

## Example Prompts

Here are some prompts to try:

```
What were my top 5 expenses this month?
```

```
Compare my income and expenses for Q1 vs Q2 this year.
```

```
Show me all transactions related to "Amazon" in the last 90 days.
```

```
What percentage of my spending goes to each category?
```

```
How much did I pay in rent over the past year?
```

## Custom AI Context

In **Settings**, you can provide custom context about your financial situation. This helps the AI give more relevant answers. For example:

> "I'm a freelance software developer. My main income comes from two clients. I have a business checking account at TD and a personal account at RBC. My fiscal year ends March 31."

The AI includes this context in every conversation for more personalized responses.

## Model Configuration

OpenFinance uses **OpenRouter** to access AI models, with **Cerebras Llama 4 Scout** as the default for fast responses. You can change the AI model in **Settings** under the AI section. Any model available on OpenRouter can be used.

## Limitations

- The AI can only access data that has been uploaded and processed in OpenFinance
- It does not provide specific investment advice or tax advice
- Each conversation turn allows up to 5 tool calls to prevent runaway queries
- The AI cannot modify your data -- it is read-only
