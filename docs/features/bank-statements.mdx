# Bank Statements

OpenFinance extracts transactions from bank statement PDFs using AI. Upload a PDF, and the system automatically identifies transactions, amounts, dates, and balances.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload a PDF">
    Navigate to **Statements** and click **Upload Statement**. Select one or more bank statement PDF files.
  </Step>

  <Step title="AI processes the statement">
    The system converts PDF pages to images, extracts text, and sends both to the configured AI model via OpenRouter. The AI identifies:
    - Bank name and account number
    - Statement period (start and end dates)
    - Opening and closing balances
    - All individual transactions with dates, descriptions, and amounts
  </Step>

  <Step title="Balance verification">
    After extracting transactions, the system calculates whether the sum of transactions matches the stated opening and closing balances. If there is a discrepancy, the AI retries extraction (up to 15 attempts) to improve accuracy.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Transactions are saved">
    Once verified, all transactions are saved to the database and automatically linked to the correct bank account. If the account does not exist yet, it is created.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Banks

OpenFinance works with any bank that provides PDF statements. The AI model adapts to different statement formats. Commonly used with:

- Canadian banks (TD, RBC, BMO, Scotiabank, CIBC)
- US banks (Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo)
- Credit unions and online banks

## Statement Details

After processing, each statement shows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Bank Name | Automatically detected from the PDF |
| Account Number | Extracted account identifier |
| Period | Start and end date of the statement |
| Opening Balance | Balance at the start of the period |
| Closing Balance | Balance at the end of the period |
| Verification Status | Whether the extracted transactions balance correctly |
| Transaction Count | Number of transactions extracted |

## Viewing a Statement

Click on any statement to see its detail view. This shows all extracted transactions for that statement period, along with the verification status.

## Duplicate Detection

OpenFinance computes a content hash for each uploaded PDF. If you upload the same file twice, the system detects it as a duplicate and warns you.

## Tips

- Upload statements in chronological order for the best experience with balance tracking
- Statements work best when they are unmodified PDFs from your bank (not scanned paper copies)
- After processing, review the transactions and correct any categorization errors -- the AI learns from your data patterns over time
